## 💀 Does not feature
- A password vault
- Account management
- Cloud services
- A back-end server
- A database
- A JavaScript framework
- Dependencies on external software
- Leaks
- *Worries*

NOPAZ deterministically generates "random" passwords based off of your master passphrase and a site id. 

Configurations are stored as bookmarks which can be kept in your browser or a note taking app.
